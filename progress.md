so in exirsite 01 syntax, i need to pu the type u32 in the function signature


in exercise 02_varibales,
i learn that let and const are mutually exclusive, so i can't use let and const for the same variable declaration

and i can just declare a const variable if one of the variables to calculate it is not a const
correction for this line : A `const` variable must be initialized with a constant expression and is immutable.

so i use let mut to declare a mutable variable
